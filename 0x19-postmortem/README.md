Project Title: Web Stack Debugging 


Project Date: 12-Dec-2022 to 14-Dec-2022
Introduction:
This postmortem outlines the issue that occurred in the web stack debugging project and the steps that were taken to resolve it. The aim of this postmortem is to document the problem, its impact, root cause, and the lessons learned to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
Issue Description:
On 13th December 2022, users reported that the website was slow to load and unresponsive. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the server was down, and the website was inaccessible.
Impact:
The issue caused significant downtime for the website, affecting its availability and causing frustration for users. The downtime also resulted in lost revenue for the business as the website is a critical component of the company's operations.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the issue was determined to be a memory leak in the web application. Over time, the leak caused the server's memory usage to grow, eventually leading to the server running out of memory and crashing.
Resolution:
To resolve the issue, the web application was restarted, and the memory leak was fixed by releasing unused memory resources. The web application was also optimized to better manage memory usage and prevent future issues.
Lessons Learned:
Regular monitoring of server resource usage is critical to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
Regular code review and testing can help identify potential issues and prevent them from becoming critical problems.
Implementing proactive measures such as adding alerts for high memory usage can help quickly identify and resolve issues before they cause significant impact.
Conclusion:
The web stack debugging issue was a significant challenge, but the team was able to resolve it quickly and effectively. The lessons learned from this incident will be used to improve the stability and reliability of the web stack and prevent similar issues from happening in the future.
